# Test Case 16 – Shaft Openings
## Test Description:
It is typical to find a service shaft in a commercial building. These shafts offer the ability to route various utilities such as air ducts to the roof units. The space is usually unconditioned and runs vertically from bottom to the top.   
## Spaces / Rooms:
There are two spaces in this test model. One space is located at the first floor, named as “level_1_space_1”. The other one is located at the second floor, named as “level_2_space_1”.
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10’ x 10’ x 21’ (including floor and roof thickness, using center line)
2.	The model has two stories and each story is one space.
3.	The structure floor, roof and slab on grade have thickness of 1’.
4.	Wall thickness is 8”.

### Space Volumes and Areas

| Name            | Volume    | Area  |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| level_1_space_1 | 528.00 CF | 59 SF |
| level_2_space_1 | 528.00 CF | 59 SF |
