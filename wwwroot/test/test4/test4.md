# Test Case 04 – Multi-level ceiling
## Test Description:
Multi-level drop ceiling is common to find in many buildings such as hotels and offices. This test models a multi-level drop ceiling in a space and exam whether a BIM software has the capability of capturing the plenum space correctly in the exported gbXML model.
## Spaces / Rooms:
There is just one spaces in this test model. It is located at the first floor, named as “level_1_space_1”.
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10’ x 10’ (center line)
2.	The drop ceiling has multiple levels.
3.	All the walls face to an orientation shall be named as: “[orientation]_wall_[custom index]”
4.	All the other surfaces shall be named as their function, such as “interior_wall_[custom index]
5.	The custom index is an index to differentiate the same type surfaces. The tester can decide how to label the custom index.
