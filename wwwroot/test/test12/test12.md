# Test Case 12 – Concave Shaped Zones
## Test Description:
Most spaces in commercial buildings are rectangular in shape. However, sometimes designers design a space that has a concave shape, which means one of the inner angles is greater than 180 degrees. These irregular shaped spaces could result in issues when exported to gbXML models. In this test case, software should successfully export a concave shaped space to a gbXML model.
## Spaces / Rooms:
There is only one space in this test model. It is named “level_1_space_1”. The space shape is the same as the building shape.
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model dimension is detailed in Figure 1.
2.	The exterior wall thickness is set to 8”.

### Space Volumes and Areas
| Name            | Volume     | Area   |
|-----------------|------------|--------|
| level_1_space_1 | 4114.00 CF | 457 SF |



## Description of Test Case:
### Figure 1. Isometric View
Shows a 3-dimensional isometric view of this test model. Walls are located between the slab floor and the roof.
### Figure 2. Floor and Ceiling Plan View
Shows a typical floor plan to indicate dimensions and directions of the space with wall thickness, which are important for the gbXML space and surface definitions.  

### Figure 3. Section View
Shows the south elevation view to indicate positions and dimensions of the slab floor, roof, or ceiling elements.
