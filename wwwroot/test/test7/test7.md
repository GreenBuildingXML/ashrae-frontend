# Test Case 7 – Room Inside a Room
## Test Description:
A space enclosed within another space is quite common to find in many commercial buildings. Such a layout challenges BIM authoring software tools to correctly identify the inner room space whose bounding surfaces are internal (partition walls).
## Spaces / Rooms:
There are two spaces in this test model. The space in the inner room is named “level_1_space_1” and the other space is named “level_1_space_2”.
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10’ height by 10’ wide.
2.	The inner room is 5’ x 5’ and located at the center of the outer room.
3.	The wall thickness is 8”.
4.	The thicknesses of the roof and slab-on-grade are both 1’.

### Space Volumes and Areas
| Name            | Volume    | Area  |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| level_1_space_1 | 169.00 CF | 19 SF |
| level_1_space_2 | 495.00 CF | 55 SF |
