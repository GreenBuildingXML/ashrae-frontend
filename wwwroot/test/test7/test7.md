# Test Case 7 – Room Inside a Room
## Test Description:
Space enclosing other space is common to find in many commercial buildings. Such layout challenges BIM software to correctly identify the inner room spaces whose bounding surfaces are internal (partition walls).
## Spaces / Rooms:
There are two spaces in this test model. The space in the inner room is named as “level_1_space_1” and the other space is named as “level_1_space_2”.
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10’ height and 10’ wide.
2.	The inner room is 5’ x 5’ and located at the center of the outer room.
3.	The wall thickness is 8”
4.	The both thicknesses of roof and slab on grade are 1’.

### Space Volumes and Areas
| Name            | Volume    | Area  |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| level_1_space_1 | 169.00 CF | 19 SF |
| level_1_space_2 | 495.00 CF | 55 SF |
