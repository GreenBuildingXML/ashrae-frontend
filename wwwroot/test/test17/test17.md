# Test Case 17 – Curved Wall
## Test Description:
Curved walls are an attractive design element in buildings. They can function as exterior walls, partitions and even a ceilings. However, such geometries have long been a problem when exporting from BIM to gbXML. This test case examines the BIM software capabilities of exporting a curved exterior wall to gbXML.
## Spaces / Rooms:
There is only one space in this test model. It is named “level_1_space_1”. The space shape is the same as the building shape.
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10’ height and 10’ wide.
2.	The radius is 5’.
3.	The wall thickness is 8”.
4.	The thicknesses of both the roof and slab-on-grade are 1’.
