# Test Case 17 – Curved Wall
## Test Description:
Curved walls are an attractive design element in buildings. It can function as an exterior wall, a partition and even a ceiling. However, such shapes have long been a problem when exporting from BIM to gbXML. The test case exames the BIM software capabilities on exporting an curved exterior wall into gbXML.
## Spaces / Rooms:
There is only one space in this test model. It is named as “level_1_space_1”. The space shape is the same as the building shape.
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10’ height and 10’ wide.
2.	The radius is 5’.
3.	The wall thickness is 8”
4.	The both thicknesses of roof and slab on grade are 1’.

### Space Volumes and Areas
| Name            | Volume     | Area   |
|-----------------|------------|--------|
| level_1_space_1 | 1147.89 CF | 128 SF |
