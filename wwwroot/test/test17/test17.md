# Test Case 17 – Curved Wall
## Test Description:
Curved wall is an attractive design element in buildings. It can be functioned as exterior wall, partitions and even ceilings. However, such shapes have long been a problem in the BIM to gbXML. The test case exames the BIM software capabilities on exporting an curved exterior wall into gbXML.
## Spaces / Rooms:
There is only one space in this test model. It is named as “level_1_space_1”. The space shape is the same as the building shape.
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10’ height and 10’ wide.
2.	The radius is 5’.
3.	The wall thickness is 8”
4.	The both thicknesses of roof and slab on grade are 1’.

### Space Volumes and Areas
| Name            | Volume     | Area   |
