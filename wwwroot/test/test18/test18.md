# Test Case 18 â€“ Window Frame
## Test Description:
This test case creates an integrated glazing system (IG) that consists of glazes and frames. It examines whether the BIM software is capable of exporting such as system to gbXML.
## Spaces / Rooms:
There is one space in this test model. It is named "level_1_space_1".
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10' height and 10' wide.
2.	The wall thickness is 8".
3.	The thicknesses of both the roof-and-slab on grade are 1'.
