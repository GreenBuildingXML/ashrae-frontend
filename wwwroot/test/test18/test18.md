# Test Case 18 â€“ Window frame
## Test Description:
The test case creates an integrated glazing system (IG) that consists of glazes and frames. It exams whether the BIM software is capable of exporting
## Spaces / Rooms:
There is one space in this test model. It is named as "level_1_space_1".
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10' height and 10' wide.
2.	The wall thickness is 8".
3.	The thicknesses of both roof and slab on grade are 1'.
4.	All the walls face to an orientation shall be named as "[orientation]_wall_[custom index]"
5.	All the other surfaces shall be named as their function, such as "interior_wall_[custom index]"
6.	The custom index is an index to differentiate the same type of surfaces. The tester can decide how to label the custom index.
