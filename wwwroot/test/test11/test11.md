# Test Case 11 – Vaulted Ceiling With Dormer
## Test Description:
This case is developed to test a pitched roof, which has a dormer, can be recognized correctly in the exported gbXML model. If the roof is successfully exported with the correct surface type, then the test is passed, else, failed.
## Spaces / Rooms:
There is one space in this test model. It is named as “level_1_space_1”.
## Special Considerations:
1.	The model is 10’ x 10’ x 21’ (including floor and roof thickness, using center line)
2.	The model has two stories and three spaces.
